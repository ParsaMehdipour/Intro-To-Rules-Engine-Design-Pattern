# Intro-To-Rules-Engine-Design-Pattern

A rules engine is all about providing an alternative computational model. Instead of the usual imperative model, which consists of commands in sequence with conditionals and loops, a rules engine is based on a Production Rule System. This is a set of production rules, each of which has a condition and an action - simplistically you can think of it as a bunch of if-then statements.
